# TODO idea: instead of tree-like structure of government,
# try more distributed structure where in each of many domains there is a separate tree-ish structure leading to a panel of experts (but then can redo the tree-to-distributed transformation on those if necessary to make it even less power-pyramid-like)
# find a way to simulate decision making in such a system, see what they do versus what a tree-like power structure would do
