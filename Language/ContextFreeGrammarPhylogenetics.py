# Program that generates context-free grammars. If the grammar compiles, it is selected for and entered into the training population again. Mutations will accumulate. Keep track of the grammars that compiled and how they reproduced into new ones. Make phylogenetic tree. See how different the surface structures are from point to point. I bet there would be some crazy punctuated equilibrium with massive restructuring shifts. Could be a way to show the implausibility of generative models for diachronic syntax if actual languages donâ€™t undergo the kinds of changes it produces?
