todo for ConlangWorkspaceGUI

bugs:
- not recognizing new used_phonemes, later sound changes don't apply to them
    to see, use rule k>[kÊ·],C>_
    the kw's will still be there
- inflectionless words don't show any forms in lexeme form list
    (they should just show one form that is equal to the citation form)

features:
- visualize tree of language evolutions, 
    be able to switch to a different version of the language history
- number every event with a sequential "tick" number
- command to create new lexeme at a specific point in time
- create CommandProcessor class, every single thing the user does in the gui
    should create a text command which is sent to the processor, THEN the command
    actually does stuff to the language, words, etc.
- every possible sequence of actions in the gui should be recordable as a text file of commands
- load existing command file / lexicon
- undo sound change
- sound change with set of phonemes defined on the fly, e.g. (r,u,k,i:1)s>(1)s
- sound change with capturing groups, e.g. (C:1)V(C:2)#>(2)V(1)# would change apik>akip
- should sound changes use regex?
- terminal ability, allow command input and show history (in this branch of tree)
- sanity check
- homophone check
