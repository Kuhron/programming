todo for ConlangWorkspaceGUI

bugs:
- inflectionless words don't show any forms in lexeme form list
    (they should just show one form that is equal to the citation form)

features:
- visualize tree of language evolutions, 
    be able to switch to a different version of the language history
- number every event with a sequential "tick" number
- command to create new lexeme at a specific point in time
- every possible sequence of actions in the gui should be recordable as a text file of commands
- undo sound change
- sound change with set of phonemes defined on the fly, e.g. (r,u,k,i:1)s>(1)s
- sound change with capturing groups, e.g. (C:1)V(C:2)#>(2)V(1)# would change apik>akip
- should sound changes use regex?
- sanity check
- homophone check
- click on phoneme, see what classes it is in, what features it has, where it is used,
    what phonetic environments it occurs in
