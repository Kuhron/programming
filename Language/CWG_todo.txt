todo for ConlangWorkspaceGUI

bugs:
- inflectionless words don't show any forms in lexeme form list
    (they should just show one form that is equal to the citation form)
- inflections do not undergo sound change if a new lexeme is added later

features:
- visualize tree of language evolutions, 
    be able to switch to a different version of the language history
- number every event with a sequential "tick" number
- command to create new lexeme at a specific point in time
- every possible sequence of actions in the gui should be recordable as a text file of commands
- undo sound change
- click on line in terminal command history and create branch from there
- should sound changes use regex?
- sound change with set of phonemes defined on the fly, e.g. (r,u,k,i:1)s>(1)s
- sound change with capturing groups, e.g. (C:1)V(C:2)#>(2)V(1)# would change apik>akip
- sound change with optional phonemes, e.g. a(r?)C_#>aaCa#
- sanity check
- present words that need to be reviewed after a check finds them
- click on phoneme, see what classes it is in, what features it has, where it is used,
    what phonetic environments it occurs in
- command to edit a single lexeme or single form, some unambiguous way to designate the
    one you want to edit, without being dependent on what order the words were entered
    - the designation could be the form gloss, enforce no duplicate glosses
    - (synonyms could just be e.g. "after", "after2", "after3"), but that is kinda ugly
    - it could be form + gloss since if those both coincide then we should consider them equal
    - then you can use regex to select those designations
- view color-coded grid of inflections of a lexeme
    - (colors same for homophones)
- orthography
    - this is a sub-language like the sound change commands
    - e.g. something like:
        - ortho <g> /É£/
            except <gi> /z/
            except <[p,t,k]gi> /[\1]s/
