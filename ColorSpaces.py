# idea to play with perceptual color spaces
# etic colors are a set of wavelengths, each with an associated intensity
# equivalently, intensity as a function of wavelengths
# so etic colors live in R^infinity
# emic colors are based on the receptors you have
# each receptor has a responsivity function of wavelength
# emic colors are the activations of the receptors
# so emic colors live in R^n_receptors
# so sometimes different etic colors will create the same emic color
# it would be fun to play with these equivalence classes
# e.g. what if I have several receptors with bimodal activations (two normal distributions added together, say), what do the equivalence classes look like?
