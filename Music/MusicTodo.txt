TODO
- handle sysex messages and instrument changes from Yamaha piano, make sure instrument changes work in playback
- remove homebrew MidiEvent class and other old homebrew stuff that can be replaced with mido code, use mido for as much of this as possible to make it clean
- implement drum track syncing with first note of improv that is played on top of it
- implement duet graph, where one piece is played plus some transformation and then I improvise on top of that
- make some nice terminal interface for navigating the midi files and deciding what to do with them (play, record, transform, show duet tree, etc.)
- figure out a way to stop the notes that are still being pressed when I KeyboardInterrupt out of playing MIDI data


more ambitious:
- implement a way for user to change the volume of a midi track while it's playing from the computer, so I can hear myself play quieter instruments like epiano without the accompaniment drowning it out


DONE
- change recording of midi from piano to just the raw midi data rather than my midi objects, so no info is lost, and then can convert to another object type on the fly if so desired (DONE, it never was my own objects, it was always pickling the MIDI raw data as a list)
- play midi data files from computer audio (I think this is already implemented?)
- convert all saved MIDI recordings to txt format and implemented reading/writing those with mido
