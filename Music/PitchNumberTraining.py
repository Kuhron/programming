# purpose: to train myself to use a continuous scale of semitone numbers without relying on note names / octave numbers
# mostly for learning which pitches a person talks on

# select random pitch
# have user input the pitch number (MIDI convention where 69 = A440, 0 = C_-1)

# would also be great to have a continuously varying pitch like human speech, user needs to change answer periodically to keep up with it (but this will be a lot harder to implement)
