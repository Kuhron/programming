# another idea for Language and Cognition experiment, give people colors that are fully saturated and full-value, with the only variable being hue (which is topologically a circle)
# they have to do a communication game to name the stimuli, BUT unbeknownst to the participants, the hue is rotated by some constant random amount between them
# so e.g. if it's + 1/3, then the describer might say "red" but the listener sees yellow; this could be a way to prevent them from cheating and using real language terms
# and it would be able to control for the pre-existing linguistic color categories that the speakers have, e.g. they make finer distinctions in the red-orange-yellow area than they do in the green-blue area, but this is shifted among them so those biases won't "line up" and new category boundaries may result
# the options given as potential answers can also be easily measured in terms of how far off the answer was, so we can quantify the accuracy better than just right/wrong
