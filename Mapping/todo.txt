- convert point number icosa files to point codes; done
- double check where north pole is on Imis Tolin map: cell NQ211 in the csv of point codes = row 211, col 381, it is farther up in the image from where I originally marked it, but it is close enough, northwest of Vergensi and still on the land of Eawortis
- double check where south pole is on Oligra-Zitomo map (this one matters less): cell PE279 in csv = row 279, col 421, this is good, very close
