- fix bug where interpolation is overwriting existing elevations with default values
- make equirectangular maps centered on their center longitude (matplotlib usually does this, but need to fix it in the case where region crosses the antimeridian)
- figure out math for orthographic projection of stuff near the poles, so I can see better maps of IT and O-Z
- I could try gradating the conditions in the map generation to get slope (by adding a higher proportion of pixels of a certain type in an area of the image), like as you go inland it's a 50/50 mix of ocean/shallow, then mostly shallow, then start adding some dots of land, then 70/30 shallow/land mix, and so on
- once have a bunch of elevation generated, look at a bunch of it and see if anything looks weird/wrong
-- can use smoothing to get rid of things like pockmarks from intervening higher-iteration points being at default while the grid around them already has data on it

done (and I want to remember that I did them already so I don't repeat them):
- double check where north pole is on Imis Tolin map: cell NQ211 in the csv of point codes = row 211, col 381, it is farther up in the image from where I originally marked it, but it is close enough, northwest of Vergensi and still on the land of Eawortis
- double check where south pole is on Oligra-Zitomo map (this one matters less): cell PE279 in csv = row 279, col 421, this is good, very close
